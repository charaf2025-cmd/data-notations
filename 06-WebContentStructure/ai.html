    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>

    <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields and techniques, such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to recommend products or shows based on your previous interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate roads and make driving decisions.</p>

    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing. However, ethical considerations, such as job displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also key topics of discussion. The development of AI is likely to reshape many industries and aspects of daily life in the years to come.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>: A branch of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics</strong>: AI powers robots to perform tasks autonomously, often in environments that are too dangerous or complex for humans.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Systems</strong>: AI-based systems designed to mimic human expertise in specific domains.</li>
    </ol>
